Productivity is the basic measure of performance considering the value of outputs (products and Services) and value of input. 
Productivity=f(Input,Output)
P=Output/Input
Multifactor Productivity (MFP): comprises all the inputs 
Outputs: Profit, Revenue, Sales, Customer satisfaction
Inputs: Labor hour/cost, Material cost, Machine cost, Distribution cost, Overhead cost or any other costs

Based on the above information,
1. Three employee process 600 insurance in a week. They work for 8 hours per day, 5 days per week. Calculate the labor productivity.

2. A train service charges Tk 18 per ticket plus Tk 3 as surcharge to fund planned equipment upgrades. It expects to sell 4700 tickets during the eight week summer season. During that period, the train service will experience Tk 110,000 in labor cost. Materials required for each ticket sold is Tk 1.30. Overhead during the period comes to Tk 79,000.
What is the Multifactor productivity ratio?
If the train service staff work an average of 310 person-hours per week for the 8 weeks of summer season, what is the labor productivity ratio?  

3. Compute the multifactor productivity measure for an eight-hour day in which the usable output was 300 units, produced by three workers who used 600 pounds of materials. Workers have an hourly wage of $20 and material cost is $1 per pound. Overhead is 1.5 times labor cost.

4. A health club has two employees who work on lead generation. Each employee works 40 hours a week, and is paid $20 an hour. Each employee identifies an average of 400 possible leads a week from a list of 8,000 names. Approximately 10 percent of the leads become members and pay a one time fee of $100. Material costs are $130 per week, and overhead costs are $1,000 per week. Calculate the multifactor productivity for this operation in fees generated per dollar of input.  

Answer above questions.

    To calculate labor productivity, we need to know the output (600 insurance policies processed) and the input (labor hours). Each employee works 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, for a total of 40 hours per week. So the total labor hours for the three employees is 3 x 40 = 120 hours per week. Therefore, the labor productivity is:

Labor productivity = Output / Input
Labor productivity = 600 / 120
Labor productivity = 5 insurance policies per labor hour

    To calculate multifactor productivity, we need to know the value of all inputs and outputs. The outputs are profit, revenue, sales, and customer satisfaction, but we do not have enough information to calculate these. Therefore, we will use the input and cost information to calculate the multifactor productivity ratio.

Inputs:

    Labor cost: Tk 110,000
    Materials cost: Tk 1.30 x 4700 = Tk 6,110
    Overhead cost: Tk 79,000
    Surcharge revenue: Tk 3 x 4700 x 8 = Tk 112,800

Total inputs = Tk 307,910

Outputs:

    Revenue: Tk 18 x 4700 x 8 = Tk 676,800

Multifactor productivity = Output / Total inputs
Multifactor productivity = Tk 676,800 / Tk 307,910
Multifactor productivity = 2.20

To calculate labor productivity, we need to know the labor hours worked and the output. The labor hours worked is 310 hours per week for 8 weeks, for a total of 2,480 labor hours. The output is 4700 tickets sold. Therefore, the labor productivity is:

Labor productivity = Output / Input
Labor productivity = 4700 / 2480
Labor productivity = 1.90 tickets sold per labor hour

    To calculate multifactor productivity, we need to know the value of all inputs and outputs.

Inputs:

    Labor cost: 3 workers x 8 hours x $20 per hour = $480
    Materials cost: 600 pounds x $1 per pound = $600
    Overhead cost: 1.5 x $480 = $720

Total inputs = $1,800

Outputs:

    Usable output: 300 units

Multifactor productivity = Output / Total inputs
Multifactor productivity = 300 / $1,800
Multifactor productivity = 0.17

    To calculate multifactor productivity, we need to know the value of all inputs and outputs.

Inputs:

    Labor cost: 2 workers x 40 hours x $20 per hour = $1,600
    Materials cost: $130
    Overhead cost: $1,000

Total inputs = $2,730

Outputs:

    Membership fees: 400 leads x 8,000 names x 10% conversion rate x $100 per member = $320,000

Multifactor productivity = Output / Total inputs
Multifactor productivity = $320,000 / $2,730
Multifactor productivity = 117.17

Therefore, the health club generates $117.17 in membership fees for every dollar of input.
